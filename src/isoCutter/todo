	- Add function calculating face centres and areas from new face points (done)
	- Add function that extracts face centres and areas from fully submerged faces (done)
	- Add function that calculates volume from this taking care of area vector direction (done)
- Add function to find fully submerged faces of each cut cell (done)
- Add function to calculate submerged part of cut faces for each cell (done)
