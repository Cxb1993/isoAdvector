Todo to bring the code to the level before the HD failure:
- Rerun test cases including MULESadvector to test state of codes.
- Setup unstructured advectedDisk case
- Setup scalarTransportFoam cases with HRIC, CICSAM, upwind, vanLeer01 (get setups from navaFoam cases)
- Setup notchedDisk/Zalesak test case (Remember stream function approach to calculating fluxes from analytical velocity field)
- Setup diskInVortex case (-||-)
- Setup unstructured version of advectedDisk

To bring the code further:
- Setup unstructured version of advectedSphere
- Reimplement method to find isovalue that gives VOF value
- Make switch that allows one to turn on/off debug messages from isoAdvector

- Implement isoAdvector in interFoam instead of MULES: isoInterFoam
- Setup filling tank case
- Setup standing wave test case 

- Develop and implement consistent boundary conditions for isosurface reconstruction step.

Done:
- Make each isoAdvector test case have its own isoAdvector folder with isoAdvector.C and createFields.H so fields can be set individually for each case (done).
